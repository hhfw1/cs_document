# How to create your own document.

Each document is assigned to a specific category. This category can be <b>public</b> for everyone or a <b>job name</b> to be accessible only by citizens in that specific job.
Each document consists of a <b>headerTitle</b>, <b>headerSubtitle</b> and <b>elements</b>.
headerTitle and headerSubtitle are self explanatory.
Elements are the fields which a user fills in, in a document.
An element, so far, can either be <b>input</b> or <b>textarea</b>.
Each element has the following properties:
* <b>can_be_empty</b> : true/false which means a user can submit the form without filling that specific element
* <b>can_be_edited</b> : true/false which means a user can edit this element's content. Usefull for documents with static values.

So let's see an example. Let's say we want to create a witness testimony document. This can be filled by anyone so we put it in the public section. Also we want the citizen to fill in the date of occurence and his testimony. Hence we have:
<table>
<tr>
 <td width="30%"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kx5G0vy/Untitled.png" width="100%"></td>
 <td width="70%">

  ```
-- We add our document to the public section
-- Click the image on the left to see the code translation
["public] ={
        {
          headerTitle = "WITNESS TESTIMONY",
          headerSubtitle = "Official witness testimony.",
          elements = {
            { label = "DATE", type = "input", value = "", can_be_emtpy = false },
            { label = "TESTIMONY", type = "textarea", value = "", can_be_emtpy = false },
          }
        },
        ....
}
```
 </td>
</tr>
</table>

We were known as HH Framework and recently we have changed our name to Code Studio. Our Old Scripts are also Available.
